Step 1: Set up the environment

Install Node.js: Go to the Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the latest stable version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions.
Create a new project folder: Choose a directory where you want to create your project. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to that directory, and create a new folder for your project.
Initialize a new React project: Run the command npx create-react-app product-review-app. This will create a new React project in a folder called product-review-app. Change into that directory using cd product-review-app.

Step 2: Understand the project structure

Open the project folder in a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom).
In the src folder, you will find the index.js file, which is the entry point for your React application. The main component of the app is located in App.js.

Step 3: Set up the sample data

In App.js, copy the provided productsData array at the top of the file. This array represents your sample product data.

Step 4: Create a ProductReviewApp component

Define a new functional component called ProductReviewApp that returns the base structure for your product review app. Remember to import React and useState at the top.

Step 5: Create the state variables

Inside the ProductReviewApp component, use the useState hook to create two state variables: selectedProduct and reviews. Set their initial values to null and an empty array, respectively.

Step 6: Create helper functions

Define two functions: handleProductClick and handleReviewSubmit. These functions will update the state when a product is clicked or a review is submitted.

Step 7: Render the product list

Create a function called renderProducts to render the list of products using the provided productsData. Use the map function to loop through the products and display their names, descriptions, and prices.

Step 8: Render product details and reviews

Create a function called renderProductDetails that will render the details of the selected product, including its name, description, price, and any reviews if available. If there are no reviews, display a message indicating that there are no reviews yet.

Step 9: Create the ReviewForm component

Define a new functional component called ReviewForm. This component will be used to submit reviews for a selected product. Pass the onSubmit function as a prop to this component.

Step 10: Add form fields

Inside the ReviewForm component, use the useState hook to create two state variables: rating and comment, with initial values of 5 and an empty string, respectively.
Create two event handlers: handleRatingChange and handleCommentChange. These functions will update the state when the user changes the rating or enters a comment.

Step 11: Implement the form submit

Add a submit button to the form, and create a handleSubmit function to handle the form submission. This function should call the onSubmit prop with the rating and comment as arguments and then reset the form fields.

Step 12: Styling (optional)

Add some basic CSS to style your app. You can create a new CSS file or use inline styles within your components. This step is optional but can make your app look more presentable.

Step 13: Integrate the ReviewForm component

Inside the renderProductDetails function, import the ReviewForm component and include it below the product details and reviews.

Step 14: Event handling

Set up event handlers in the ProductReviewApp component to call handleProductClick when a product is clicked and handleReviewSubmit when a review is submitted.

Step 15: Test your app

Run your React app using the command npm start from the project root directory. Your app will open in a web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Step 16: Testing the functionality

Click on a product to see its details and review form.
Submit a review for the selected product.
Verify that the review is displayed under the product details.
